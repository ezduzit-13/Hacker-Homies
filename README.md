This is a markdown file that will give the overview of our ideas and whatever else we wanna say.


  ## Ideas 
### Hospital Map
- We will create a map that the user can then use to find a hospital near them
- the user should then be able to filter out certain hospitals based on their insurance plan, procedure, and maybe other things 

### Drugs idea
- Users will be able to look at data regarding pharmacuticals. They can look at past prices and use AI to guess future prices. 

### Patient dashboard
- find a way to create a single app that a patient can use in order to view past visits, current medication, past test results ...etc
- cons:
  - one problem I can see here is I am not sure how we will go about getting data for this.

### Use ai to scan for brain cancer




## Datasets

### Hospital buildings dataset
The first dataset is a dataset of hospital buildings. We can use this data to find all of the hospital buildings in san diego and then add these buildings to our map so that the user can see them. 

The data will have the following information: 
- County Code
- Perm ID
- Facility Name
- City
- Building Nbr
- Building Name
- Building Status
- SPC Rating *
- Building URL
- Height (ft)
- Stories
- Building Code
- Building Code Year
- Year Completed
- Latitude
- Longitude
- Count
