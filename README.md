# Hacker Homies Homepage

This is a markdown file that will give the overview of our ideas and whatever else we wanna say.


  ## Ideas 
### Hospital Map
- We will create a map that the user can then use to find a hospital near them
- the user should then be able to filter out certain hospitals based on their insurance plan, procedure, and maybe other things 

### Drug idea
- Users will be able to look at data regarding pharmacuticals. They can look at past prices perhaps and then maybe we can use AI to try and guess future prices. 

## Datasets
The first dataset is a dataset of hospital buildings. We can use this data to find all of the hospital buildings in san diego and then add these buildings to our map so that the user can see them.
