# Hacker Homies Homepage

This is a markdown file that will give the overview of our ideas and whatever else we wanna say.

# Ideas 
## Hospital Map
- We will create a map that the user can then use to find a hospital near them
- the user should then be able to filter out certain hospitals based on their insurance plan, procedure, and maybe other things 

## Drug idea
- Users will be able to look at data regarding pharmacuticals. They can look at past prices perhaps and then maybe we can use AI to try and guess future prices.
