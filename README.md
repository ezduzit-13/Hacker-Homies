This is a markdown file that will give the overview of our ideas and whatever else we wanna say.


  ## Ideas 
### Health Facility Map
- We will create a map that the user can then use to find a health facilities near them
- the user should then be able to filter out certain hospitals based on their insurance plan, procedure, and maybe other things 
- Includes hospitals, clinics, dentists, pharmacies, and any other needed health facilities
- Provides not only routes accesible by car, but also by public transportation, biking, and walking
- Shows average premium for each facility
- Shows which insurance works where

### Drugs idea
- Users will be able to look at data regarding pharmacuticals. They can look at past prices and use AI to guess future prices. 

### Patient dashboard
- find a way to create a single app that a patient can use in order to view past visits, current medication, past test results ...etc
- cons:
  - one problem I can see here is I am not sure how we will go about getting data for this.

### Use ai to scan for brain cancer (stable diffusion to draw references images)

### Prescription reminder app
- Remind patients to take medications different medications
- Allow healthcare providers to update, edit, or create perscriptions, then notify the patient

## Datasets

### Hospital buildings dataset
The first dataset is a dataset of hospital buildings. We can use this data to find all of the hospital buildings in san diego and then add these buildings to our map so that the user can see them. 

The data will have the following information: 
- County Code
